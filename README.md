**A NOTE:** Initial microbiome processing was performed in 2019 and not by me. Steps taken are described in the methods section of the paper, but they can also be seen by opening a .qza or .qzv file provided at [view.qiime2.org](view.qiime2.org) and looking under the provenance tab. Clicking on each step will show the commands and parameters given to QIIME2 that produced all files I worked with. I have provided one qzv file in this repository for doing so.

My code notebook has also been provided as an HTML file, which can be viewed by reviewers without Jupyter notebook installed.
